Description: A systematic biology tool was developed to identify cell infiltration via an Individualized Cell crosstalk network. 'CITMIC' first constructed a weighted cell crosstalk network by integrating Cell-target interaction information, biological process data from the Gene Ontology (GO) database, and gene transcriptomic data in a specific sample, and then, it used a network propagation algorithm on the network to identify cell infiltration for the sample. Ultimately, cell infiltration in the patient dataset was obtained by normalizing the centrality scores of the cells.
